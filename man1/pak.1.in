.SH "NAME"
pak \- PAK file editor for Quake engine games.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
pak [OPTIONS] 
.I [FILES]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

A utility for manipulating .PAK files used by Quake and Quake 2 engine games.  Allows for creation of .PAK data files from directores, extraction, individual file/directory insertion and extraction, and file/directory deletion.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI -V
Print licence
.TP
.BI -i " filename.pak"
Import to this filename.  If the pak file does not exist, it will be
created, otherwise it is appended to.
.TP
.BI -o " filename.pak"
Export to this filename.  When importing a file or directory tree,
this file will be created if it does not already exist.
.TP
.BI -d
Directory to import from, export do.  When importing to a pak, this is
the directory containing what will be imported.  Everything under the
directory will be added, but not the directory itself.  These will form
the 'root' directory of the pak file.

When exporting, the files/directories will be placed within this
directory.

When deleting, this is the path within the PAK file to delete.

.TP
.BI -D
Import/export file.  Like the -d option, but works with files.  You can
either add a file to the pak file, or extract a file.  When extracting,
the full path must be specified.

When deleting, this is the file to delete.

.TP
.BI -p
Internal pak path to use.  An existing pak file can contain directories
within it, such as 'sound/ogre'.  This option allows you to use
a subdirectory within a pak file as the target for operations.
For importing files or directories, the -p option exports only
subdirectories, or imports to that directory.  This option allows you
to specify where the file or directory tree will go.

.TP
.BI -v
Verbose. Print more information.

.TP
.BI -l
List PAK file contents.

.TP
.BI -x " filename.pak"
Delete directory of file from PAK file.  Files are specified with the '-D'
parameter and directories with the '-d' parameter.  Note the directory
deletion is recursive.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
pak \-i test.pak \-d /storage/ulysses This creates a new file
called test.pak, which will contain the contents of the directory
/storage/ulysses

pak \-o test.pak \-d /temp This extracts the contents of test.pak to
the /temp directory

pak \-i test.pak \-p /sound/ogre \-d /storage/ogre This imports the
files/directories under storage/ogre into the pak file, placing them
within the pak under /sound/ogre

pak \-i test.pak \-p /sound/ogre \-D pain.wav The same as above, but
inserts pain.wav in the pak under /sound/ogre

pak \-e file.pak \-p sound \-d target Exports the 'sound' directory in
file.pak to directory 'target'.

pak \-e file.pak \-D sound/misc/basekey.wav Exports the file
sound/misc/basekey.wav

pak \-x file.pak \-d sound/ogre
Delete 'sound/ogre' directory in the PAK file recursively.

pak \-x file.pak -D maps/e1m1.bsp
Delete 'maps/e1m1.bsp' from the PAK file.


.SH "NOTES"


The full path cannot exceed 56 characters.  If you are importing
files and directories, the total length of the directory names and
file name cannot exceed 56 characters due to limitation of the PAK file
format. Pakqit will stop importing if this limit is exceeded.

Pakqit does not allow two files within one directory to have the
same name.


.SH "BUGS"
Please report any you see.
